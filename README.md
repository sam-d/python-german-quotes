# SmartyPants learns german

This is a first quick hack to get correct german single and double opening and
closing quotes.

    9 Word 6
    99 Word 66

These are, to my knowledge `&bdquo;/&#8222;` for opening double quotes and
`&ldquo;/&#8220;` for closing ones. `&sbquo;/&#8218;` for opening single quotes
and `&lsquo;/&#8216;` for closing ones.

# TODO

- add other german typographical specialties (em/en dashes between dates, number
  ranges etc...)
- make it interantional by providing all the correct defaults based on the user
  locale.
